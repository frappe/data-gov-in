A better visualisation of data.gov.in

[codeformumbai.org](http://codeformumbai.org)

This project aims to make better tools for visualising government data. We expect data
to come in any format: text, csv, xls, pdf, word and in any language and we plan to 
make scripts to convert this data in to a web friendly format and also give APIs

### Technology

The scripting is in Python and the site is generated using simple cgi scripts without
and back-end framework. The datasets at the moment are in csv and the metadata is in json.

We plan to shift this to databases at a later point.
